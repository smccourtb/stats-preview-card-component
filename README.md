## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

With this challenge I got to play around with rem and em a little more which helped me gain a better understanding. With more practice I should have it down in no time.

The other challenging area was coloring the image. I tried a few different methods including background-color and filter. Filter was close but I couldn't 'deepen' the color enough which led me to color-burn.

### Continued development

In the future I will be working on sizing in general.

### Useful resources
